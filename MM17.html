                    <h2>Golden Village</h2>
                    <h3>
                        I spent an evening with an ancient old man —<br>
                        A friendly and kind joker...<br>
                        He said, Pamir old-timer,<br>
                        And I wrote... I put it in poems.<br>
                        - My father told me as a child<br>
                        (so began the tale of the cunning sage),<br>
                        And my father was told by my grandfather,<br>
                        And my grandfather's great-grandfather, and there is no beginning,<br>
                        That somewhere in someone's village is a neighbor,<br>
                        Freed from the troubles of life,<br>
                        People summoned, asked for forgiveness,<br>
                        Sighed, and quietly, with the last of his strength,<br>
                        He announced his former secret,<br>
                        Quoth:<br>
                        "Once, in previous years,<br>
                        When the hand was still firm,<br>
                        I went out hunting... All day<br>
                        The deer chased away. A deer took me in.<br>
                        Into the mountainous desert... I ran<br>
                        On steepness and on ledges of rocks;<br>
                        And, having greatly shrunk, he fell sick.<br>
                        After all, more than a day, thirsty tomim,<br>
                        I didn't know any rest or sleep...<br>
                        I lie down and see: the distance in the mountains is clear,<br>
                        From another mountain, from a snowy height<br>
                        A river of heavenly beauty runs...<br>
                        I have never seen such water anywhere else.<br>
                        And so I got up and ran to the water,<br>
                        And he immersed his face in the stream,<br>
                        And he drank so much that he couldn't drink anymore.<br>
                        Suddenly I notice: the apple is floating —<br>
                        No, not a wild game, but the best fruit.<br>
                        I picked it up, surprised,<br>
                        And he turned from all sides,<br>
                        And I thought for a long time, and could not understand,<br>
                        And he was surprised, and whispered again:<br>
                        "Why are you here on a mountain glacier,<br>
                        In the snows, from all life far away,<br>
                        Oh sweet, juicy, round, golden,<br>
                        A fun ball, juice poured?<br>
                        Perhaps there is a village among the snows?<br>
                        Oh no. They don't build villages in the snow..."<br>
                        I lay down again, keeping the rest of my strength...<br>
                        But curiosity tormented me,<br>
                        And I went in search of one...<br>
                        I don't remember how or where, among the peaks,<br>
                        I found myself in a secret flower garden...<br>
                        Not a stone — I held a rose in my hand.<br>
                        I saw some people there.<br>
                        They, happy, are not equal to us.<br>
                        Although in the spring we are a little intoxicated,<br>
                        But the proud dignity is full.<br>
                        Winter and summer, stone and water<br>
                        Those people were subdued forever.<br>
                        Then I said, as I recall, the words:<br>
                        "Here's a man's power..."<br>
                        I stepped there like sand, leg<br>
                        On yakhonts, corals, pearls.<br>
                        The dishes of the golden house are full,<br>
                        And it has no gold price...<br>
                        All the kids there play as they want,<br>
                        There young men will not be forbidden to love,<br>
                        And how many old people have I seen there,<br>
                        Surrounded by a crowd of students.<br>
                        There is no enmity between people at all;<br>
                        Who asks: give, - the answer is ready: take it.<br>
                        There are brothers all, there is no trace of malice,<br>
                        There, as a man, a woman is proud.<br>
                        No one wants to avoid work.<br>
                        Without bothering, he will not taste the fruit,—<br>
                        To them work is pleasant, as in the heat of water,<br>
                        Because it's never infertile:<br>
                        There is everything that touches a person with his hand, -<br>
                        Comes to balance and peace...<br>
                        Farmers! I was in paradise during my lifetime.<br>
                        And I don't hide the truth before I die.<br>
                        After all, this paradise is not the law of the earth,<br>
                        That man is not doomed to grow old,<br>
                        That in moderation with summer mixed winter,<br>
                        That the bounty is not guarded by the sum,<br>
                        That one who is too wise will not go mad,<br>
                        That May is not doomed to leaf fall,<br>
                        That joys do not require retribution...<br>
                        I was in paradise, poor farmers...<br>
                        My deathbed watch is bitter,<br>
                        My sins must be great,<br>
                        That I have not found more than that river,<br>
                        I didn't find that road again.<br>
                        In the mountains of the unknown lurks a dol,—<br>
                        I don't remember the area was called how,<br>
                        But it seems to me - "Golden Village".<br>
                        So, at the paradise I stayed with the dehkan;<br>
                        I was sweet with their hearty dastarkhan:<br>
                        Honey, butter, sugar, milk, nabot-<br>
                        That's not going to hurt.<br>
                        "Live with us without grief and worries,"<br>
                        This kind people told me.<br>
                        "Forget your home in your bad country."<br>
                        The elders advised me.—<br>
                        Why are you going to be in trouble again?"<br>
                        I couldn't answer for a long time...<br>
                        And bowing his head low, low,<br>
                        I started crying... My answer was true:<br>
                        "Happy," I said, "I can't.<br>
                        Free, I said, I can't.<br>
                        To the birthplace of deprivation and care<br>
                        My father's sadness is calling me;<br>
                        My children are being suffocated by the oppression;<br>
                        Their grief dries, their resentment oppresses;<br>
                        After all, immature trees are akin to,<br>
                        There were cute little children left alone..."<br>
                        Offended the wise men the answer is this,<br>
                        He was confused by something bright about their peace.<br>
                        One looked into my soul sadly.<br>
                        And I put a blindfold over my eyes...<br>
                        "You're not in captivity. Go to your home.<br>
                        We are waiting for you and your family to visit.<br>
                        You will be a welcome brother to us again,<br>
                        As long as the way back you can find.<br>
                        We are in secret forever,<br>
                        We don't discover how to get here;<br>
                        You yourself will find the path to the monastery.<br>
                        I'm sorry, if you offended, go away."<br>
                        And I went the lost way.<br>
                        And he returned to his squalid house...<br>
                        I wanted to take my children to a distant paradise,<br>
                        But I was afraid of my own ventures:<br>
                        Will we withstand the hardships of the roads?<br>
                        Won't God punish for courage?<br>
                        Won't the cold get expensive?<br>
                        Is there trouble on the way?<br>
                        Are the rocks falling by the river?<br>
                        Are the ovrings strong enough?<br>
                        Bears are dangerous in the Himalayas.<br>
                        You'll get into the rapids, look.<br>
                        Look, you'll fall off the cliff.<br>
                        Little children are grabbed by eagles...<br>
                        Besides, you can't get enough food on the way,<br>
                        You can't take a home skarb with you.<br>
                        So my life in doubt passed...<br>
                        The haze is already thickening in my eyes.<br>
                        I lived and die poor,"<br>
                        I am familiar with all the misfortunes,<br>
                        And sons and grandsons are poor,<br>
                        Still far from happiness...<br>
                        Oh, where are you, golden villages?<br>
                        Where are the banks of an unknown river?.."<br>
                        So he said, and so he died,<br>
                        Neighbors in the dugout are surrounded;<br>
                        A tear froze on his cheek.<br>
                        And it's all about the poor old man...<br>
                        But about that time stories about places,<br>
                        Where May is eternal and where fear is unknown,<br>
                        The Pamirs spread throughout the country.<br>
                        The Pamir highlander is hungry and sir,-<br>
                        You won't find a poor person like that anywhere.<br>
                        Should a person live without a dream?<br>
                        Poets composed bayats,<br>
                        The singers sang the land of beauty...<br>
                        It happened sometimes,<br>
                        That people disappeared without a trace,<br>
                        On the search for the barren gone<br>
                        On the trails of wind, snow and rain...<br>
                         
                         
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        I was in my distant youth.<br>
                        Not better than the rest and not stupider,<br>
                        And in adulthood I was a quiet man, —<br>
                        Pamir stone is used to plowing,<br>
                        And he didn't know if he was close or far away.<br>
                        The Road of the Golden Village.<br>
                        I, the poor man, had a strongman's brother,<br>
                        I once said to my brother in a hurry:<br>
                        "Oh, my brother, let us give up the bitter life.<br>
                        My shirt has worn out on me,<br>
                        Your dugout fell apart,<br>
                        Above her, the rock sways, hanging,<br>
                        Our harvest is two handfuls of barley.<br>
                        O strong brother, obey me.<br>
                        We, except for death, cannot wait for the benefits—<br>
                        Widem, let's look for the Golden Village."<br>
                        My brother replied, "I'm ready to go too."<br>
                        There were ten of us countrymen;<br>
                        We decided that not in one way,<br>
                        And we're going to go in different directions, —<br>
                        To whom luck smiles,<br>
                        Others will be notified and called...<br>

                        I had a son, Sharafjon...<br>
                        I was leaving, and he wept bitterly,<br>
                        And my wife cried all night;<br>
                        And I took the sour grass rivoj:<br>
                        For lack of good grain,<br>
                        You know, the food for the wanderers is...<br>
                        That's how my brother and I wandered away.<br>
                        We passed — black, in the dust,<br>
                        On the trails and roads of different countries.<br>
                        Got to Balkh and saw Iran;<br>
                        In the mountains of the Tien Shan wild fields<br>
                        We were deceived, happiness was promised to us.<br>
                        We were seen by a leopard at the Gerirud River;<br>
                        We were hired as farmhands —<br>
                        That baranta to protect among the steppes,<br>
                        That on pruning poppy stems...<br>
                        Winter and summer in ragged chapans<br>
                        We went to different teahouses;<br>
                        In the nostrils is the earth like the felt of a beard,<br>
                        Like dervishes, they entered the cities...<br>
                        In total, more often than not, our path ran.<br>
                        In the deserts stony between the rocks.<br>
                        And everywhere, passing beyond the distance,<br>
                        The same sadness was seen,<br>
                        The same woe-poverty,<br>
                        Same fuss and futility.<br>
                        We were young when we left.<br>
                        In search of an unknown land.<br>
                        We are tired, we are old on the way,<br>
                        And they couldn't get to it.<br>
                        Not giving me a joyful day,<br>
                        Fate mortally wounded me:<br>
                        My beloved brother died of hunger...<br>
                        His parting gaze was full of tears,<br>
                        And with that look, like a star trembling,<br>
                        My soul also went out next to me...<br>
                        Desperate, I lost my strength,<br>
                        It was as if a brother had taken them to the grave;<br>
                        Like a small child, weak and small,<br>
                        Desperate, I became crazy.<br>
                        And I remembered about my native village<br>.
                        And again I wandered with the hope of one, —<br>
                        Enter under the canopy of squalid housing,<br>
                        Where I was poor and where I prayed,<br>
                        Where over an empty pot of grass<br>
                        Two birthmarks bowed,<br>
                        Where my old catman stands in the corner,<br>
                        There is a nightmare on the earthen floor...<br>
                        But I didn't know the roads to my homeland,<br>
                        And in my wanderings I was exhausted again;<br>
                        I lived in caves, avoided people,<br>
                        There was a kite hungry thinner.<br>
                        To those heights the beast did not wander,<br>
                        Where I wandered in horror.<br>
                        I lost track of time a long time ago,<br>
                        I wasn't given days to distinguish;<br>
                        In the steppe one day, through the fog of heat,<br>
                        I saw the walls of ancient Bukhara,<br>
                        And the blue behind the dusty veil<br>
                        Hotan or Yarkand in front of me,—<br>
                        Or maybe the tomb of the Taj Mahal...<br>
                        But I ran away in a roundabout way,<br>
                        Trying to avoid the worst ordeal,<br>
                        Fearing the Sarbaz on the borders of the kingdoms.<br>
                        And, how much strength I have left,<br>
                        And I've already wasted everything without keeping it;<br>
                        Like a yellow leaf, a broken shard,<br>
                        I became flat and lay down on the road...<br>
                        Bad dreams woke me up.<br>
                        Amidst the nightly, cold silence.<br>
                        I got up with difficulty, trembling in my rag;<br>
                        I climbed the steep path,<br>
                        And he cried out, like a lightning snake.<br>
                        Pierced me from head to toe.<br>
                        Sparkling, diamond, gold,<br>
                        All poured, like juice, beauty,<br>
                        The world was emblazoned on the crest of a mountain,<br>
                        All in the subtle jets of rainbow play,<br>
                        Though small, full of blessings to the brim...<br>
                        "Behold," I shouted, "here is the Golden Village!"<br>
                        With difficulty waiting for the morning rays,<br>
                        I hit the road. A creek sang a song to me.<br>
                        Some familiar, but I<br>
                        I couldn't understand the creek speeches yet...<br>
                        The sides are thick and wide.<br>
                        Carpets spread flower beds;<br>
                        And what's behind them? Heaven or earth?<br>
                        Cloud-like fields,—<br>
                        So sometimes wavy and free.<br>
                        There are clouds around the moon...<br>
                        That best cotton ripened,<br>
                        A goose from the testicle was shining.<br>
                        The breeze was blowing, caressing, not dusting;<br>
                        Poplars rose high;<br>
                        Large kibitkas even rows<br>
                        Located near the water;<br>
                        Everywhere you look – orchards:<br>
                        The fruits glow with flames,<br>
                        And the bees, flying, thank you<br>
                        Blooming sumbula fragrance...<br>
                        Suddenly, I noticed that the girl was coming.<br>
                        She exclaimed frightenedly, "Wai dod!"<br>
                        Frightened and laughing, surprised,<br>
                        She stared at the wanderer.<br>
                        As a Hinduush yak, I was a shaggy man;<br>
                        My robe was worn, tailed;<br>
                        Gray cosmas covered the gaze,<br>
                        A toothless mouth burned the silence of the poison...<br>
                        And bitter shame and anguish,<br>
                        I said only, "My daughter,<br>
                        I don't have and I didn't have housing,<br>
                        I have seen many lands,<br>
                        Mihnatabad from Rushan I,<br>
                        By the lord of the fathers, Ismailia...<br>
                        Here, if paradise, how do I enter as a trapper?<br>
                        And if it's an earthly land, tell me, whose?"<br>
                        But the girl brought the man,<br>
                        Similar in posture to an eagle;<br>
                        He began to ask who I was.<br>
                        In one hand - kalam, kitab - in the other,<br>
                        And I, in my pure conscience,<br>
                        I told everything from the very first days.<br>
                        "Who are you?" I finally asked.<br>
                        And there was an answer:<br>
                        "I am Sharafjon, father."<br>
                        "Oh son! I screamed and shook all over —<br>
                        Is there the Golden Village? Are we both here?<br>
                        How did you find the promised land?<br>
                        Did he bring an old mother? answer!"<br>
                        People from all sides began to flee,<br>
                        Said in front of all the people of Sharafjon;<br>
                        "Father, don't cry. Master yourself.<br>
                        You are in your own country, in your homeland.<br>
                        You're in our old, old village:<br>
                        Here's Black Mountain not far away:<br>
                        On the shred where you stand now,<br>
                        There was once our old house, believe me<br>.
                        You've been away for twenty years, ata,<br>
                        You were possessed by an ancient dream,<br>
                        That there is a happy country somewhere—<br>
                        Full of love and pity, she...<br>
                        No, happiness is not ready anywhere,<br>
                        Not on the ground, not on another star.<br>
                        Happy and unhappy there are no planets,<br>
                        And there is no pity, Father, in heaven.<br>
                        You're at home. All that you see here—<br>
                        Garlands of roses and this cotton all,<br>
                        And every fruit, and every new home<br>
                        Obtained by our will and work.<br>
                        We blew up a gloomy rock,<br>
                        That the haze was haze over the district,<br>
                        Smoothed out the hillocks on the slopes of the mountains,<br>
                        Suitable only for divas to play.<br>
                        A stream that raged without end,<br>
                        We took the bridles like a stallion.<br>
                        And they turned to new places,<br>
                        And they straddled the fortress of the bridge.<br>
                        Humbled half-demon — half-horse:<br>
                        The dam was erected as the law;<br>
                        We admire the shaggy and grizzled,<br>
                        A beard broken into three strands.<br>
                        And the wondrous light that you saw,<br>
                        Not by magic arose from the darkness:<br>
                        You see, there's a khana standing over the water.<br>
                        Like a chang or a rubab, she<br>
                        For the music of the mighty born:<br>
                        It has strings and pegs.<br>
                        For the giant, demonic hand.<br>
                        Here, instead of a song, we get light, —<br>
                        He is, by nature, a musical neighbor.<br>
                        Check, Father, my story is true.<br>
                        No, this is not paradise, we do not have immortals.<br>
                        It was a difficult road. In the grave the mother lies,<br>
                        A green barn guards the grave...<br>
                        We don't have paradise. Every step was hard,<br>
                        Not all the Golden Village has been completed,<br>
                        But in a clear land, we know a straight path.<br>
                        You're going to rest. Let's go home, Father..."<br>
                        That's what Sharafjon told me in front of people.<br>
                        Everyone was following us. And he added:<br>
                        "From now on, we will live together, not apart.<br>
                        Lie on the carpets, robe decayed throw,<br>
                        Put on my shirt clean..."<br>
                        But I said, "Son, where's my ketmen?<br>
                        I enter the poor in the pure lands...<br>
                        Is my old hoe alive?<br>
                        You, son, are flying on a fiery horse,<br>
                        Come on, I'll go out like a catman.<br>
                        But, you know, I haven't died yet.<br>
                        May my hand come in handy..."<br>
                        It was not in a dream, but in reality.<br>
                        Now I live in Stalin's collective farm."<br>
                         
                         
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *<br>
                         
                        So said Rushana an old-timer.<br>
                        I wrote it down and put it in poems.<br>
                        I didn't insert anything from myself.<br>
                        And he didn't diminish his speeches.<br>
                        May it come down to my story<br>
                        He who is stronger than the gods and demons,<br>
                        Whose will to the Pamirs led me,<br>
                        May they be famous, in the centuries of his deeds.<br>
                        Who, hundreds of times the foliage changed,<br>
                        Like an oak tree, it ends up surviving;<br>
                        Who fights in blood, but will not die,<br>
                        Who is omnipotent and merciful? - People.<br>
